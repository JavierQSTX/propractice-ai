  "question": "You have resolved an issue for an existing Customer. What should you say to transition into the Customer Review?",
  "briefing": "<p>This module trains bankers at Northfield Bank to proactively initiate essential financial review conversations with clients. You will learn to transition into a client review after resolving an issue, or when engaging new or existing clients. The objective is to confidently identify evolving financial needs, offer relevant solutions, and deepen client relationships by demonstrating a commitment to their long-term financial well-being through confidential, complimentary service. In the assessment, you will respond to client statements, focusing on acknowledging their situation, stating your responsibility to help achieve financial goals, explaining the benefits of a review (understanding needs, finding helpful solutions, potentially saving time/money), and clearly communicating the complimentary, confidential, and time-efficient nature of the service, all while using a formal and precise tone.</p>",
