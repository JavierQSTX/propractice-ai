    "Rhythm and Timing": "After “achieve their financial goals,” you move on quickly. That’s the value line—give it space to land. Add a brief pause, then restart smoothly with “Because circumstances change over time…” so the message feels inviting, not rushed.",
    "Volume and Tone": "Your tone is professional and clear. Add warmth on “save time and money” to increase helpfulness—smile slightly and round the voice on “save,” then soften the ending so it sounds like a benefit for them, not a pitch.",
    "Emotional Authenticity": "Your sincerity comes through, but “complimentary” and “confidential” should sound reassuring. Slow down slightly and lower your tone on “confidential.” Try: “This is complimentary—and completely confidential,” then let it land before continuing.",
    "Confidence": "Your delivery is steady; strengthen the close so it feels decisive. Remove softeners and lead with a direct invitation: “Let’s get started now—does 10 to 15 minutes work?” Take a natural breath before the question to project leadership."
